# LemonadeStandGame
Sell some lemonade!

You start out with 1 lemon, 1 ice cube, and $10. You can buy more lemons for $2 each and new ice cubes for $1. You will have new customers everyday. Don't forget to pay attention to the weather-- the warmer it is, the more customers you will have.
The goal of the game is to try to last as many days as you can!
